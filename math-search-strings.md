# Math Search Strings

> [!TADA] Updated and tested!

`%s` search strings because reasons.

## Questions

> [!QUESTION] Why are there two versions for some sites?
> Some sites produce different results with different search strings.

> [!QUESTION] Why are some sites so slow?
> Math people made them, they have different priorities. 

> [!QUESTION] Why are some sites so weird?
> See answer to previous question.

> [!QUESTION] Why didn't it work *"all the way"*
> If you searched more than a one word query you gotta replace any spaces with `%20`
> If that doesn't work try `+`

> [!QUESTION] It says page not found
> Check spelling
> Page with that name might not exist, try different search terms
