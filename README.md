# MathSearchURLs


Originally, I made this to use with different iOS apps. 


I use these mostly with [s](https://github.com/zquestz/s) custom provider config. 


## Probably Don't 

The [Drafts](Drafts.md) and [LaunchCenterPro](LaunchCenterPro.md) are outdated, probably don't use those.


## Do

[math-search-strings](/math-search-strings.md)

Is updated, tested, slightly expanded and uses the handy `%s` placeholder!

## Added but who knows

Also added [More](more.md) which I had stored in a gist. I haven't tested them in years, some are even http. Knock yourself out if you want. I guess.


## All the Smoke

Certain extremely successful app developers caught the subscription bug so hard, they decided even basic search action creation was a no for them. 

(Even if you bought every single version of their apps) 

LaunchCenterPro I don't have a use for anymore.

1Writer is maybe abandonware at this point? idk
