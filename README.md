# MathSearchURLs


Originally, I made this to use with different iOS apps. 


However, certain app developers  caught the subscription bug and decided even basic search action creation was a hard no for them. 

(Even if you bought every single version of all their apps... fix Terminology it's half broken)

LaunchCenterPro I just don't have a use for anymore.

1Writer is maybe abandonware at this point.

I use these mostly with [s](https://github.com/zquestz/s) custom provider config. 


## Probably Don't 

The [Drafts](/Drafts.md) and [LaunchCenterPro](LaunchCenterPro) are outdated, probably don't use those.


## Do

[math-search-strings](/math-search-strings.md)

Is updated, tested, slightly expanded and uses the handy `%s` placeholder!


(Yea all the smoke)
